Below is a high-level list of the concepts and lessons that beginners will encounter in this project, organized by category (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/DOM, and general web development practices). This should help new developers see what they can learn by studying or working on this code.

1. HTML Concepts
	1.	Basic Structure
	•	The skeleton of an HTML page (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>).
	•	How to link external CSS (<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />) and JavaScript files (<script src="script.js"></script>).
	2.	Form Creation and Organization
	•	Using the <form> element to group inputs related to “Add Episode.”
	•	Input fields with different types (text, number, url) for collecting user data.
	•	Labeling inputs correctly with <label for="...">.
	3.	Required vs. Optional Fields
	•	Demonstration of required attributes to enforce minimal validation.
	•	Using optional fields (HOH, Veto, Nom, Placement) that do not need required attributes.
	4.	Links (<a>) vs. Buttons (<button>)
	•	Understanding differences in default behavior.
	•	Choosing type="button" on <button> elements to avoid unwanted form submissions.
	5.	Adding Visual Indicators for Required Fields
	•	Using a <span class="required-asterisk">*</span> to show which fields are mandatory.

2. CSS & Styling
	1.	Basic CSS Organization
	•	Keeping CSS rules in an external stylesheet (main.css).
	•	Structuring code with comments and sections (e.g., layout, table styling).
	2.	Layout with Flexbox
	•	Using .flex { display: flex; } and gap classes (.gap-8) to space out sections.
	3.	Form and Input Styling
	•	Making inputs visually consistent with custom backgrounds, borders, focus states.
	•	Adding subtle transitions (transition: all 0.2s ease;).
	4.	Customizing Table Appearance
	•	Centering a table (margin: 0.5rem auto;).
	•	Using border-collapse and custom cell padding.
	5.	Focus and Hover Effects
	•	.vote-cell:focus to show a custom focus ring.
	•	.vote-cell:hover to highlight table cells on mouse hover.
	6.	Hiding Elements but Preserving Behavior
	•	Using pointer-events: none and opacity: 0 for the <input type="checkbox"> so that the entire .vote-cell is clickable/focusable.
	7.	Responsive Design
	•	Media queries (@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }) to adjust layout for smaller screens.

3. JavaScript & DOM Manipulation
	1.	DOMContentLoaded Event
	•	Running code only after the HTML is fully parsed and ready (document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ...)).
	2.	Event Listeners
	•	Adding listeners for click, keydown events on elements like buttons, links, and table cells.
	•	Using preventDefault() to block default behavior (e.g., preventing form submission on Enter).
	3.	Creating & Removing DOM Elements Dynamically
	•	Generating a <div> for each new matchup.
	•	Removing matchups from the DOM when clicking “X” to delete.
	4.	Form Validation
	•	Manually checking input[required] fields and ensuring at least one matchup is present.
	•	Displaying an alert if something is missing.
	5.	Tab Indexing & Keyboard Navigation
	•	Using tabindex="0" on .vote-cell to let users navigate by keyboard.
	•	Handling keydown events for toggling votes when pressing Space or Enter.
	6.	Click and Keyboard Toggle
	•	Emulating “radio button” behavior using <input type="checkbox"> plus logic that unchecks others in the row.
	7.	Data Collection and Object Construction
	•	Collecting user inputs from the form, building an episodeData object (title, hosts, matchups, votes).
	•	Logging that object to the console as an example of how you would send data to a backend.
	8.	Preventing Form Submission with Enter
	•	Checking the target.tagName to allow Enter only on <a> or <button> elements.
	9.	State Management
	•	Tracking whether “Add 3 Matchups” was used (hasUsedAddThreeMatchups).
	•	Dynamically enabling/disabling UI elements based on application state (e.g., if matchups exist, if user has used certain features, etc.).

4. General Web Development Practices
	1.	Separation of Concerns
	•	Keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files.
	•	Ensuring each file has its own role: structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), behavior (JS).
	2.	Progressive Enhancement / Graceful Degradation
	•	If JavaScript is disabled, the user can at least see the form but cannot add dynamic matchups, etc.
	3.	User Experience & Accessibility
	•	Including focus states on interactive elements so keyboard users can see where they are.
	•	Minimizing required fields to reduce friction for the user.
	4.	Iterative Validation
	•	Alerting once if any required fields are missing, rather than repeatedly.
	•	Letting the user correct all errors at once.
	5.	Resetting Form State
	•	Demonstrating how to .reset() a form, then re-initialize default data, ensuring a brand-new start after submission.
	6.	Readability & Maintainability
	•	Using code comments, clear variable names (e.g., handleVoteSelection, updateMatchupTables) to make the project easier to follow.
	•	Breaking the code into smaller functions (e.g., renderHosts, updateUI) rather than doing everything in one huge block.

Summary

By working through this project, a beginner can learn HTML (form structure, required fields), CSS (flex layouts, focus states, styling tables, media queries), and JavaScript (event listeners, DOM manipulation, form validation, logic flow with flags like hasUsedAddThreeMatchups). It also touches on accessibility (making the entire cell clickable and focusable), and usability (preventing accidental submissions, providing minimal validation, resetting the form).

All these lessons combine into a realistic mini-application that is a great stepping stone for further web development.

Here’s a paragraph-style overview of the key concepts and lessons covered in this project, from HTML and CSS basics to more advanced JavaScript interactions and best practices in web development:

This project showcases fundamental HTML structure by demonstrating how to link external stylesheets and JavaScript files, as well as how to build forms with both required and optional input fields—such as text, number, and URL types—and how to organize them using labels and placeholders. You’ll see how some fields (for example, “HOH,” “Veto,” “Nom,” “Placement,” “Episode #,” and “YouTube link”) can be optional, while others (like “Episode Title” and the houseguests’ “Name” and “Season”) remain required. The form itself is structured using <form> elements and is prevented from auto-submitting when pressing Enter unless the user is focused on links or buttons, which introduces the concept of overriding default browser behavior through JavaScript event handlers.

On the CSS side, the project uses flexbox for layout and includes responsive design considerations with media queries for smaller screens. You’ll see how to style tables for “vote cells” and apply focus/hover states to make keyboard navigation and mouse interactions more intuitive. By hiding checkboxes (with opacity and pointer-events) and instead focusing on the entire table cell as a clickable element, the UI becomes more user-friendly while still remaining accessible. The CSS also illustrates how to provide custom focus rings for keyboard users, and how to add visual indicators (asterisks) to show which fields are required.

In JavaScript, you’ll learn about handling the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before running code, and how to dynamically update the DOM by adding or removing matchups and hosts. This involves creating new elements, attaching event listeners, and collecting data from multiple input fields to assemble a final episodeData object. You’ll also see how to manage “radio button–like” behavior using checkboxes by manually unchecking all other options in the same row. Additionally, the script demonstrates minimal form validation logic—verifying only that required fields aren’t blank and that at least one matchup exists—along with displaying a single alert if something is missing. There’s also a simple “one-time” feature for adding three matchups at once and a flag (hasUsedAddThreeMatchups) to ensure this functionality can’t be repeated. Finally, the project showcases how to reset the form state after submission, returning to a default setup of hosts and allowing the user to start fresh. Together, these concepts provide a well-rounded example of building a small, interactive web application that melds HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a coherent experience.
