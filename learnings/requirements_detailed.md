## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture
```

```

### Data Structures

#### Episode
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  date: string,
  hosts: Host[],
  matchups: Matchup[]
}
```

#### Host
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  votes: number,
  matchHistory: {
    wins: number,
    losses: number,
    totalVotes: number
  }
}
```

#### Matchup
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  episodeId: string,
  contestant1: {
    hostId: string,
    votes: number
  },
  contestant2: {
    hostId: string,
    votes: number
  },
  winner: string | null  // hostId of winner
}
```
