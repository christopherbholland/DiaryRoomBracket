Hereâ€™s a summary of the schema, completed tasks, and upcoming development tasks for your project:

Schema

Houseguest

Represents contestants in the matchups.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const houseguestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  seasons: [{ type: String }], // Seasons the houseguest appeared in
  hohWins: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  vetoWins: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  nominations: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  placement: { type: Number }, // Final placement in the season
  daysPlayed: { type: Number, default: 0 }, // Total days in the house
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Houseguest', houseguestSchema);

Matchup

Represents the matchups between houseguests.

const matchupSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  houseguest1: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Houseguest', required: true },
  houseguest2: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Houseguest', required: true },
  votesForHG1: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  votesForHG2: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  votersForHG1: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Host' }],
  votersForHG2: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Host' }],
  winner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Houseguest' },
  round: { type: Number, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Matchup', matchupSchema);

Episode

Represents episodes where matchups take place.

const episodeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  episodeNumber: { type: Number, required: true },
  episodeName: { type: String },
  youtubeLink: { type: String },
  hosts: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Host' }],
  matchups: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Matchup' }],
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Episode', episodeSchema);

Host

Represents the people hosting episodes and voting.

const hostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  episodes: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Episode' }],
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Host', hostSchema);

Completed Development Tasks
	1.	Matchup Schema Defined:
	â€¢	Added fields for houseguests, votes, voters, winner, and round.
	2.	Houseguest Schema Defined:
	â€¢	Includes attributes like name, seasons, hohWins, and placement.
	3.	Episode and Host Schemas:
	â€¢	Episodes manage matchups, and hosts are associated with episodes and votes.
	4.	MongoDB Integration:
	â€¢	Connected backend to MongoDB Atlas.
	â€¢	Verified connection by creating and saving dummy data.
	5.	Matchup Logic:
	â€¢	Designed a clear model for one-on-one matchups, including:
	â€¢	votesForHG1 and votesForHG2.
	â€¢	votersForHG1 and votersForHG2.

Upcoming Development Tasks

GraphQL Schema Implementation
	1.	Define GraphQL Types:
	â€¢	Add Matchup, Houseguest, Episode, and Host types.
	2.	Add Queries:
	â€¢	Fetch all matchups by round.
	â€¢	Fetch houseguests with their matchup history.
	3.	Add Mutations:
	â€¢	Create a new matchup.
	â€¢	Vote for a houseguest in a matchup.
	â€¢	Calculate the winner based on votes.

Resolvers for Matchups and Relationships
	1.	Query Resolvers:
	â€¢	Resolve nested relationships (e.g., fetch matchups with houseguests and votes).
	2.	Mutation Resolvers:
	â€¢	Implement logic for creating matchups and voting.

Testing and Debugging
	1.	Test Queries and Mutations:
	â€¢	Use GraphQL Playground to ensure the API is functional.
	2.	Database Validation:
	â€¢	Verify data consistency with MongoDB Compass.

Frontend Integration
	1.	Connect Frontend to GraphQL:
	â€¢	Use Apollo Client to fetch and mutate data.
	2.	Bracket Visualization:
	â€¢	Build UI to display matchups by rounds.

Summary

Youâ€™re in a great spot with the schema foundation complete and the database connected. The next steps focus on setting up the GraphQL API and preparing for frontend integration.
