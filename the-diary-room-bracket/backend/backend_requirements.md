INPUT PAGE:
Below is a plain-English summary of exactly how the input page behaves and what it does. You can copy/paste this into a new chat with ChatGPT to discuss or refine it further. This summary doesn’t include the full code; it just describes the code’s functionality.

Project Overview (Summary of the Input Page’s Behavior)
	1.	Form Structure
	•	The page contains a main form labeled “Add Episode.”
	•	It has two main sections at the top:
	1.	Episode Details: Includes an Episode Title (required), optional Episode #, and an optional YouTube link.
	2.	Hosts: Displays a list of hosts (like “Aman” and “Matt” by default). Each host is represented by a text input (required) plus a button to remove that host. You can click “+ Add Host” to create a new blank host input.
	2.	Adding Matchups
	•	There’s a section called “Episode Matchups.” Within it, you can add matchups in two ways:
	•	+ Add Single Matchup: Creates one matchup with two houseguest inputs (Houseguest 1 and Houseguest 2), each requiring only a Name and Season.
	•	+ Add 3 Matchups: Creates exactly three new matchups in one go, but can be used only once and only if there are currently 0 matchups.
	3.	Matchup Details
	•	Each matchup contains:
	1.	Two houseguest sections (Houseguest 1 and Houseguest 2), each with the following fields:
	•	Name (required)
	•	Season (required)
	•	HOH (optional number)
	•	Veto (optional number)
	•	Nom (optional number)
	•	Placement (optional text)
	2.	A “Vote Table” that lists all current hosts in rows, with two “vote cells” (one for Houseguest 1, one for Houseguest 2).
	•	You click a cell to “vote” for that houseguest. It acts like a radio button within each row (only one cell can be selected at a time per host).
	3.	A small “×” button to remove that matchup entirely.
	4.	Vote Selection
	•	For each row (representing a host), there are two clickable cells: one for Houseguest 1, and one for Houseguest 2.
	•	Clicking a cell highlights it (and checks an invisible checkbox), unchecking any other cell in that same row.
	•	You can also keyboard-navigate to the cell (Tab/Shift+Tab) and press Space or Enter to toggle it.
	5.	Keyboard & Form Behavior
	•	Pressing Enter anywhere in text fields normally submits a form, but this page prevents that unless focus is on a <button> or an <a> link.
	•	This ensures you don’t accidentally submit while typing.
	•	The “Submit Episode” button is a manual trigger; it checks minimal validation (only that certain fields marked required are filled) and ensures at least one matchup exists.
	6.	Form Submission Logic
	•	When you click “Submit Episode,” the script checks:
	1.	Are any of the required fields (Episode Title, Host Names, Houseguest Names, Houseguest Seasons) left blank?
	2.	Do we have at least one matchup?
	•	If something is missing, it shows a single alert (“Some required fields are missing…”) and stops. Otherwise, it gathers all data into an episodeData object (which includes episode title, optional fields, host list, plus each matchup’s houseguest info and votes).
	•	The code logs that object to the console (simulating sending it to a server). Then it resets the form back to its default state.
	7.	Single Use “Add 3 Matchups”
	•	You can only use “+ Add 3 Matchups” once per session.
	•	After using it, that link is disabled.
	•	If you remove those matchups, the link remains disabled unless you reset the entire form.
	8.	Resetting
	•	Submitting the form (clicking “Submit Episode”) or manually calling form.reset() (from the console) clears everything and re-initializes the default hosts.
	•	This also reactivates the “Add 3 Matchups” option for a brand-new session.

In short, this input page is a small dynamic form that lets you specify an episode’s basic info and multiple matchups. Each matchup has two houseguests and a table of votes from all hosts. It prevents accidental submissions, ensures minimal required data, and cleans up after a successful submission. The highlight is the ability to add multiple matchups, either one by one or all three at once, with a radio-like voting system for each host.
